What is the useState hook in React?

useState is a React Hook that allows functional components to have and manage state. It returns an array with two values: the current state and a function to update that state.

When and why is it used?

It’s used when you want to make your UI dynamic by storing and updating values such as counters, form inputs, toggles, etc. Without it, functional components can’t handle state.
